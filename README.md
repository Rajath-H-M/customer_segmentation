# 🌟 Customer Segmentation

This project aims to **perform customer segmentation** for an e-commerce dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior to create meaningful customer segments for targeted marketing strategies. 📊💡

## 🚀 Project Overview:
The customer segmentation project involves the following steps:

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning** and preprocessing
- 🔧 **Feature Engineering** to create metrics like **Frequency**, **Monetary**, and **Average Order Value (AOV)**
- 📉 **Dimensionality Reduction** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- 🤖 **Customer Segmentation** using multiple clustering algorithms like **KMeans** and **Agglomerative Clustering**
- 🏷️ **Profiling** and **Labeling** customer segments based on key metrics
- 🎨 **Visualizing** and **Exporting** the results for further analysis

## ✨ Features:
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess date and text features.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Get an initial understanding of the dataset and feature distribution.
- 🧠 **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features like **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary (RFM)** for customer segmentation.
- 🧪 **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA to reduce the feature space for better visualizations.
- 🔍 **KMeans & Agglomerative Clustering**: Perform customer segmentation using **KMeans** and **Agglomerative Clustering** algorithms.
- 🎯 **Segmentation Profiling**: Identify key characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., high spenders, frequent buyers).
- 🖼️ **Visualizations**: Visualize customer segments with **PCA scatter plots**, **dendrograms**, and **cluster profiles**.
