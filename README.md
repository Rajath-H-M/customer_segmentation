# Customer Segmentation

This project aims to perform customer segmentation for an e-commerce dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior to create meaningful customer segments for targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Overview:
The customer segmentation project involves the following steps:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering to create metrics like Frequency, Monetary, and Average Order Value (AOV)
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Customer segmentation using multiple clustering algorithms like KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering
- Profiling and labeling customer segments based on key metrics
- Visualizing and exporting the results for further analysis

## Features:
- 🧹 Data Cleaning  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🧠 Feature Engineering for RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)  
- 🧪 PCA for Dimensionality Reduction  
- 🔍 KMeans & Agglomerative Clustering for Customer Segmentation  
- 🎯 Segmentation Profiling  
- 🖼️ Visualizations of customer segments
